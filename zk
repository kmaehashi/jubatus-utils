Usage:
  ${CMD} <subcommand>

Subcommands:
  conf
    New in 3.3.0: Print details about serving configuration.
  cons
    New in 3.3.0: List full connection/session details for all clients connected to this server.
    Includes information on numbers of packets received/sent, session id, operation latencies, last operation performed, etc...
  crst
    New in 3.3.0: Reset connection/session statistics for all connections.
  dump
    Lists the outstanding sessions and ephemeral nodes.
    This only works on the leader.
  envi
    Print details about serving environment
  kill
    Shuts down the server.
    This must be issued from the machine the ZooKeeper server is running on.
  reqs
    List outstanding requests
  ruok
    Tests if server is running in a non-error state.
    The server will respond with imok if it is running.
    Otherwise it will not respond at all.
  srst
    Reset statistics returned by stat command.
  srvr
    New in 3.3.0: Lists full details for the server.
  stat
    Lists statistics about performance and connected clients.
  wchs
    New in 3.3.0: Lists brief information on watches for the server.
  wchc
    New in 3.3.0: Lists detailed information on watches for the server, by session.
    This outputs a list of sessions(connections) with associated watches (paths).
    Note, depending on the number of watches this operation may be expensive (ie impact server performance), use it carefully.
  wchp
    New in 3.3.0: Lists detailed information on watches for the server, by path.
    This outputs a list of paths (znodes) with associated sessions.
    Note, depending on the number of watches this operation may be expensive (ie impact server performance), use it carefully.
  mntr
    New in 3.4.0: Outputs a list of variables that could be used for monitoring the health of the cluster.

  help
    Display the usage.

localhost:2181 is used as the default ZooKeeper server.
Use ZK environment variable to override.
_EOF_
  exit 1
